        <p>At Pawlandia, we take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of personal information we collect and how it is used when you visit our website.</p>
        
        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        
        <p>We collect personal information, such as your name, email address, and phone number, when you voluntarily submit it through our website forms or when you contact us via email. We may also collect non-personal information, such as your browser type, IP address, and browsing activity.</p>
        
        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        
        <p>We use the information we collect to provide and improve our services, to communicate with you, to analyze trends and user activity on our website, and to personalize your experience. We may also use your information for marketing purposes, such as sending you promotional emails about our products and services.</p>
        
        <h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        
        <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information to third parties without your consent. However, we may share your information with trusted third-party service providers who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, as long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential.</p>
        
        <h2>Security</h2>
        
        <p>We take reasonable measures to protect the security of your personal information and to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
        
        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        
        <p>We reserve the right to update or change our Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and the revised date at the top of this page will be updated accordingly. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
        
        <p>If you have any questions or concerns about our Privacy Policy, please contact us.</p>
